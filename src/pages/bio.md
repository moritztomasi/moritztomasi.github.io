Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Nice to see you!

I'm Moritz Tomasi, a fullstack web developer based in Vienna (Austria). Originally from Bozen (South Tyrol, Italy), I moved to Vienna in 2009 to study "Computer Science and Visual Computing" at the Technical University of Vienna, which I graduated from in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science.

I made my first real experiences as a freelance working on small business websites with a designer friend of mine. Looking back I would'nt say that they are the best quality project i've done, but they made me realize that web development is the right thing for me. After completing my bachelors degree i got hired by a company called Zoomsquare.

I've been building stuff for the web now for around 10 years. First as a freelancer, where I built small business websites with a designer friend of mine. Then as a backend software engineer at Zoomsquare,
