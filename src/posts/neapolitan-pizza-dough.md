I wanted to make Neapolitan pizza at home. So I created this ingredients calculator to make it easier. You will need:

- Tipo 00 Flour: Highly refined flour which has been milled to standard "00". Make sure that its W-value is between 250-310.
- Water: Clean and free of gas.
- Salt: Any type of salt will do, but sea salt is preferred.
- Yeast: Fresh, solid, soft and beige in colour.

Now that you have a list of ingredients, you can calculate the proportions. But first a quick note regarding the water percentage: The water percentage of the dough should be somewhere between 57-70%. The longer the pizza has to stay in the oven to be evenly cooked through, the higher the water percentage should be, because the longer cooking time will dry out the dough more. If you are using a standard kitchen oven that reaches temperatures between 250-300 °C use the maximum water percentage of 70%. In case you are using a special pizza oven that can reach higher temperatures above 300 °C you can lower the water percentage to up to 57%. A lower water percentage will make the dough a little bit easier to work with and make the pizza crisper.

## Dough Instructions

- Pour the water into a large container and dissolve the yeast in it.
- Add some flour and mix well. This is important, because in the next step we are going to add the salt. The flour will act as a barrier between the yeast and the salt (salt kills yeast).
- Add the salt and mix well.
- Add the remaining flour and mix well. Let the mixture sit for around 10 minutes.
- Start kneading the dough. You should knead the dough for at least 20 minutes (very important).
- Put the pizza dough in a dry container, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours.
- Put the pizza dough on a flat surface and divide it into smaller pieces. Form them into balls.
- Place the balls of pizza dough in a dry container and make sure that they don't touch each other. Let the dough rest for 8-48 hours.

Now that the dough is ready you can start cooking, just make sure that the oven is as hot as possible.
