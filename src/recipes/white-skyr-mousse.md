In 2020 I was lucky enough (Coronavirus) to be able to spend three weeks travelling around Iceland by car with my girlfriend. While there, I got hooked on this yoghurt called Skyr. Skyr is a cultured dairy product which is similar in consistency to Greek yoghurt but contains much more protein and much less fat. During our three week stay, I ate a lot of Skyr and tried most of the available flavours. All of them were great. Anyway. On our last day, we went to a restaurant called [Grillmarka√∞urinn](https://www.grillmarkadurinn.is/) in Reykjavik, and part of the dessert was two scoops of chocolate mousse. One white and one dark chocolate. My girlfriend and I loved both of them, so we decided that we wanted to re-create them both at home and put the recipe with a handy ingredients calculator on this site. Enjoy!

## Instructions

- Put the chocolate into a bowl and melt it over a water bath.
- Separate the egg whites from the yolks, and put the egg whites in a bowl. Whisk until the egg whites become stiff.
- Put the Skyr into a separate bowl, add the vanilla sugar to it and whisk. Then gradually add the melted chocolate. Make sure that the chocolate has cooled down a little bit.
- Fold in the egg whites. Make sure not to beat too hard and try to keep in as much air as possible.
- Cover the bowl and let the mousse chill in the fridge for at least two hours.
